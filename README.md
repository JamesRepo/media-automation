# Media Automation
 
 I have a bunch of media lists to keep track of what I have watched or read and what I intend to watch or read in the future.
 
These are split into some categories:

- TV
- Film
- Books
- Games
- Music
- Podcast

The idea behind this project is to automate the data entry into these lists when I need to add something.

The lists all keep some metadata on the particular films/TV shows etc.

Libraries needed:

- Beautiful Soup
- Requests
